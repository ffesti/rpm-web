### Description {#comment:description}

When doing disk space calculations, only files from payload are
considered. The rpmdb can grow considerably in large transactions (tens
of megabytes easily), which isn\'t estimated in any way. Doesn\'t matter
normally but when space gets tight, it can become an issue. Would be
good to throw in *some* estimate for the rpmdb part, size of header
times three or something.
