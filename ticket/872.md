Verify shows change when duplicate UID used
-------------------------------------------

  Priority:      minor    Milestone:     rpm-4.12.0

### Description {#comment:description}

On a system where:

-   Two different usernames \'aaa\' and \'bbb\' are associated with the
    same UID 1234
-   A package is installed with a file \'foo\' owned by user \'aaa\' in
    the package manifest

Then rpm -V will (sometimes?) incorrectly report a changed user for
\'foo\' from \'aaa\' to \'bbb\'.

As we all know, file ownership in Linux is by UID, not username, so rpm
is doing a reverse lookup from UID to username (probably using
getpwnam(3)) and (perhaps by chance) getting the wrong answer (\'bbb\'
instead of \'aaa\') and then reporting this as a change, when in fact
there is no change.

The rpm verify algorithm for user (and similarly group) ownership should
instead be:

1.  Determine the UID associated with the installed file
2.  Lookup the username corresponding to that UID (using getpwuid(3)
    etc)
3.  Compare that with the username in the package manifest

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *invalid*.

If duplicate UIDs are present on the system then what getpwuid() returns
is just as much by chance as with getpwnam(), there\'s no abolute right
or wrong at that point.

-   **status** changed from *reopened* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

\...and close as fixed as per
[http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=348eea3a4151b1dbe6f9976ef50cd7ba3820fa79](https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231909/http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=348eea3a4151b1dbe6f9976ef50cd7ba3820fa79)

Whether the former behavior was downright incorrect is perhaps debatable
- verification showing change when the actual entries did not change
seems buggy but then duplicate uids/users can be considered inconsistent
system state, calling for investigation. With the above commit rpm now
warns about duplicates but passes the verification in these cases.

Thanks.

Just to correct the record, the original description of what the
algorithm \"should be\" was wrong. It should have stated:

1.  Determine the UID of the installed file
2.  Determine the UID of the username that is supposed to own the file
3.  Compare steps 1 and 2 for equality

-   **milestone** set to *rpm-4.12.0*.
