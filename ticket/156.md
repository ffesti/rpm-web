rpm \--initdb does not create Names database
--------------------------------------------

  Reported by:   nijel   Assigned to:   RpmTickets
  Priority:      major   Milestone:     rpm-4.9.0

### Description {#comment:description}

The Names database is not created by rpm \--initdb and rpm later
complains when it is not existing (no packages were installed, we\'re
just getting information from existing rpm packages).

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.
-   **milestone** set to *rpm-4.9.0*.

This got finally fixed in HEAD, \--initdb now initiates all the indexes
too. Not initializing the indexes doesn\'t make much of a difference for
\"normal\" rpm usage where the database is always populated but should
hurt anything either, and it made sense for some other related items\...
