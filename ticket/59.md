Disallow comparison operators in NVR, split w/o whitespace when parsing specfile

### Description {#comment:description}

rpm currently allows comparison operator chars (\<, \>, =) in Name,
Version and Release, and also requires whitespace around them in
specfiles.

I think here\'s room for two improvements:

-   Disallow use of \<, \>, and = in Name, Version and Release
-   Do not require whitespace around these in specfiles (so that e.g.
    Requires: foo\>=1 would be expanded to mean to require version 1 or
    higher of foo, instead of something named \"foo\>=1\").

See for example

and the linked bug reports for examples of problems the current behavior
causes.

No disagreement at least wrt disallowing \<\> and various other weird
characters that might get interpreted by the shell, these have security
implications too (see
[RhBug:493157](https://web.archive.org/web/20150920084434/https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=493157 "493157 in RhBug")).

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

The first point makes perfectly sense. There shouldn\'t be any of
\'\<\', \'=\', \'\>\' as a part of NVR and rpmbuild should complain
about it. This part is now fixed.

On the other hand the space before the relation makes sense wrt spec
readability so I\'d remain it as is.

The current behaviour is that if one from \"\<=\>\" is present in the N,
V or R then rpmbuild will fail.
