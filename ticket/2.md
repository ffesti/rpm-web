### Description {#comment:description}

How many times have you copied and pasted the path names printed out by
rpmbuild when it successfully builds RPMs, into another program such as
rpmlint?

    $ rpmbuild -ba foobar.spec
    [...]
    Wrote: foobar-1.0-1.src.rpm
    Wrote: foobar-1.0-1.i386.rpm

    $ rpmlint foobar-1.0-1.src.rpm foobar-1.0-1.i386.rpm

What is needed is to have an rpmbuild option or some hook / macro that
we can set so that rpmbuild automatically runs a user-defined program on
the final RPMs.
