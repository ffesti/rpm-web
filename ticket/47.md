-----------------------------------------------------------

  -------------- -------------- -------------- -----------------
  Reported by:   FlorianFesti   Assigned to:   jnovy
  Priority:      minor          Milestone:     rpm-4.8.0
  Component:     rpm            Version:       RPM Development

### Description {#comment:description}

To save space in the packages and the rpmdb a macro could limit the
changelog in binary packages. That way ancient log entries could still
be looked up in the spec file. Limit could be done by \#entries or by
time or both.

The new changelog trimming feature is now implemented upstream. The
current implementation allows changelog trimming based on changelog
entry date. It is specified via \_changelog\_trimtime macro:

\# The Unix time of the latest kept changelog entry in binary packages.\
\# Any older entry is not packaged in binary packages.\
%\_changelog\_trimtime 0
