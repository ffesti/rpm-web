### Description {#comment:description}

Currently, in Fedora, we require all packages to have this in their spec
file:

%clean rm -rf %{buildroot}

Really, this should just be a default within RPM. As Panu pointed out on
the discussion thread at fedora-devel-list:

\*\*\*\*\*

Another, perhaps simpler alternative would be making rpm inject default
%clean action when spec doesn\'t define one. To disable/customize the
default behavior, you\'d just add an empty (or otherwise custom) %clean
in the spec, no special disabler logic required.

It is of course a change of behavior in rpm but allows getting rid of
the %clean section in 99% of specs and permits backwards compatibility
too: if you want to have %clean do (or not do) whatever you want, you
just keep the %clean section in the spec. It\'d make those special cases
stand out clearly too, all you have to do is grep for %clean.

\*\*\*\*\*

Please implement. :)
