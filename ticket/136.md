### Description {#comment:description}

Here\'s one possible approach to extract interpreter dependencies from
\"\#!/usr/bin/env foo\" scripts, to be applied over the patches in
[\#134](134 "[PATCH] Allow whitespace between #! and the interpreter. (closed)")
and
[\#135](135 "[PATCH] Emit dependencies only to interpreters with absolute paths. (closed)").

The first added sed line finds /usr/bin/foo from \"\#!/usr/bin/env
/usr/bin/foo\" (however useless using /usr/bin/env that way might be)
and should be uncontroversial.

The 2nd sed line and the path loop might be a bit controversial but is
the first straightforward implementation that I thought of; for relative
things like \"foo\" in \"\#!/usr/bin/env foo\" it checks if the \"foo\"
executable is in some of \"rpm managed\" dirs that are assumed to be in
all users\' \$PATH and emits a dependency on the first found such one.

The normal case of non-absolute path is tricky as there\'s no guarantee
that the interpreter exists on the build host. One possibility could be
adding a special interpreter() dependency for it, ie \"\#!/usr/bin/env
foo\" would turn into

> /usr/bin/env interpreter(foo)

The downside is of course that I dont see a sane way to automatically
add the matching interpreter() provides :-/

Didn\'t apply yet, I suspect this needs further head-scratching.

Right, but packagers could have the package as
[BuildRequires?](/BuildRequires)\... but yep, that\'s somewhat
cumbersome. But I\'d like to point out that I think this is not that
different from say automatic python byte-compilation which is a bit of
an apples to oranges comparison but somewhat related anyway - one needs
to have python installed for that to happen, and rpm-build does not have
a dependency on python.

BTW for the things in /usr/bin that use /usr/bin/env I have on my F-12
box (a2x, asciidoc, asciidoc.py, bshdoc, gpsprof, hg-ssh,
mercurial-convert-repo, rsvg) all ones using relative paths would be
handled fine without additional [BuildRequires?](/BuildRequires) just
for the interpreter package, it\'s [BuildRequired?](/BuildRequired)
already anyway due to other reasons based on a quick lookup (caveat:
\*quick\*; could be I missed something). bshdoc uses an absolute path
(\"\#!/usr/bin/env /usr/bin/bsh\") and handling of that is also
implemented by this patch (and I think that part of the patch could be
safely applied in any case).

> Didn\'t apply yet, I suspect this needs further head-scratching.

Sure, take your time. And no problem if you end up scratching it.

You probably already realized it but if the path based approach in the
patch is taken, in case an interpreter moves from /usr/bin to /bin or
vice versa without a compatibility symlink or something like that the
dependency will break. So maybe just do it for /usr/bin and forget about
the rest\...

(\...even though the actual script using it with /usr/bin/env and a
non-absolute path would not break.)

Nod, in practise mapping non-absolute \"env interpreters\" to /usr/bin/
would work for vast majority of cases.

Yes, that part is obviously correct and will apply.

Yup. The path based approach would likely work in practise fairly well,
but \"correct\" it is not.

One (somewhat crazy) idea to determine interpreters automatically, with
pathless interepreter(foo) style provides: whenever interpreter
dependencies are present in the package being built (possibly including
scriptlet interpreters), see if the interpreter path is in the current
package. If found, then we know the path is used as an interpreter and
we can add interpreter(basename) provide for it. For added bonus, add
provides for symlinks and hardlinks to the file too. It shouldn\'t find
any false positives but considering how easily it would break (some
script is no longer shipped with a package and poof, there goes the
interpreter provide), it\'s probably not worth the trouble.

I\'m in middle of reworking the dependency generator internals atm, one
of the things that\'s going to be added is additional path-based
\"coloring\" using regexes (eventually to be read from configuration
instead of being hardcoded in rpmfc.c), eg

        { "^/usr/lib(64)?/python[[:digit:]]\\.[[:digit:]]/.*\\.(py|pyc|pyo)$", RPMFC_PYTHON },
        /* We want to grab the version we're building now, %{__python} wont do */
        { "^%{_bindir}/python[[:digit:]]\\.[[:digit:]]$", RPMFC_PYTHON },
        { NULL, 0 },

\...which would also allow marking various things as interpreters,
something like:

        { "^/bin/(da|ba|k|tc)?sh$", RPMFC_INTERPRETER },

\...but the obvious downside is that somebody somewhere needs to add
such entry for any new interepreter, so the advantage over telling
packagers to just add \"Provides: interpreter(foo)\" to their packages
is questionable.

-   **status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

RPM uses a simplified version of this that does not try to evaluate to
the full patch for quite a while now. Guess we stay with this. Closing.
