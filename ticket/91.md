This had actually been fixed in HEAD in May already (commit
[03e36789b62010026f099e885546be005a62461a](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/03e36789b62010026f099e885546be005a62461a "Unsupported version control system "svn". Check that the Python bindings for "svn" are correctly installed.")),
just not in stable branches. Thanks for the patch anyway :)
