erase doesn\'t understand epoch as an argument

### Description {#comment:description}

Previously when rpm whined something about dependencies, one could
double click the string in terminal window and paste those nvr:s into
next command\'s argument list.

New rpm outputs also epoch (nevr) in error messages, but does not
understand it as input.

An example:

    error: Failed dependencies:
            iscsitarget-kmod >= 1:1.4.18 is needed by (installed) iscsitarget-1:1.4.18-1.fc11.x86_64

and then as an input:

    # rpm -e iscsitarget-1:1.4.18-1.fc11.x86_64
    error: package iscsitarget-1:1.4.18-1.fc11.x86_64 is not installed

and this succeeds when erased with plain:

    # rpm -e iscsitarget

It would be nice if this (much needed) epoch handling would be expanded
into erase too at some point of development.
