%sources macro gets expanded twice in case there is a BuildArch entry present
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Reported by:   belegdol   Assigned to:   pmatilai
  Priority:      major      Milestone:     
  Component:     rpm        Version:       RPM 4.7.x

### Description {#comment:description}

In case of the following spec file:\
[http://belegdol.fedorapeople.org/sdlmame-data-samples.spec\[\[BR](https://web.archive.org/web/20150920122424/http://belegdol.fedorapeople.org/sdlmame-data-samples.spec%5B%5BBR)\]\]
The %{sources} macro will get expanded twice, causing the build to
fail:\
[http://belegdol.fedorapeople.org/build-0133-1.fc12.log\[\[BR](https://web.archive.org/web/20150920122424/http://belegdol.fedorapeople.org/build-0133-1.fc12.log%5B%5BBR)\]\]
It would be nice to have this fixed so that this new RPM 4.6 feature
could be used to its full extent, especially that Fedora 9 is now EOL
and all active branches support it.
