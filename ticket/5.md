rpm fails with \"cannot open Packages database\"

### Description {#comment:description}

rpm -i \<package\> fails with \"cannot open Packages database\" error on
GNU/Hurd system. After quick debugging problem is in
rpmdb.c:openDatabase function. It has this code there:

if (mode & O\_WRONLY)

> return 1;

Main problem is that GNU/Hurd has this O\_RDWR definition:

\#define O\_RDWR (O\_RDONLY\|O\_WRONLY)

so rpm fails even if O\_RDWR is set. POSIX says:

\"In historical implementations the value of O\_RDONLY is zero. Because
of that, it is not possible to detect the presence of O\_RDONLY and
another option. Future implementations should encode O\_RDONLY and
O\_WRONLY as bit flags so that:

O\_RDONLY \| O\_WRONLY == O\_RDWR \"

I\'m not sure what will be the proper patch because Linux has O\_RDONLY
== 0. It seems that \"\#ifdef linux\" will help or that condition will
be eliminated.

-   **status** changed from *new* to *assigned*.

Ok, that\'s a nice one, will do - there are a few other places in rpm
that need a similar change.

-   **status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

Should be fixed now in rpm.org HEAD, all access mode tests are now done
using O\_ACCMODE masks (unless of course I missed some spot :)
