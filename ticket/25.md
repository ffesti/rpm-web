Type set by tag extensions not honored in queryformat

### Description {#comment:description}

    $ rpm -q --fileclass telnet
    /usr/bin/telnet 0
    /usr/share/man/man1/telnet.1.gz 0

This got broken by the rpmtag/rpmtd class stuff, at least in case of
RPMTAG\_FILECLASS the real tag is integer type but the extension is a
string array, rpmtdClass() gets this wrong by using rpmTagGetClass()
causing it to think it\'s dealing with integers.
