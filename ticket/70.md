RFE: Allow multiple -f options to %files

### Description {#comment:description}

Currently, at least with rpm 4.6.1, multiple -f options to %files does
not work as expected; the last one given trumps all previous ones.
Making it possible to specify multiple -f\'s would get rid of the
annoyance where one has to fiddle with concatenating all generated file
lists into one.

Dummy test case specfile attached.
