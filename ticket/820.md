Rpmdb should keep better track of its children

### Description {#comment:description}

It\'s way too easy to create dangling iterators. Trivial reproducer in
python

    >>> import rpm
    >>> ts = rpm.ts()
    >>> mi = ts.dbMatch('name')
    >>> ts.closeDB() # or del ts for that matter

\...and poof, mi\'s locks can\'t be released without exiting the process
(or calling rpmdbCheckTerminate() on C-side which ends up doing the
same).

Rpm should close + invalidate the iterators before closing the db itself
to avoid creating these zombies.

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

This was simpler than I thought: iterators take a refcount on the
database so all that is needed is to use rpmdbClose() on iterator free
instead of only decrementing refcount.
