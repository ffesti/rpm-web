\[PATCH\] Consider packages that would build with \--specfile
-------------------------------------------------------------

  -------------- ---------- -------------- -----------------
  Reported by:   lkundrak   Assigned to:   pmatilai
  Priority:      major      Milestone:     rpm-4.9.0

### Description {#comment:description}

Currently \--specfile takes all package structures into account, even
those which would not result in binary packages since they lack %files
section. This typically causes trouble with packages that only build
into subpackages, since the user has no way if finding out which
packages would actually build.

To retain compatibility in that case this adds the source package to the
list, using \"src\" as an arch, which makes it distinguishable from the
binary packages.

Ping.

/me feels like no one loves him :(

/me thinks the more useful approach would be adding a method (cli switch
or such) to access things from the source header instead. That avoids
changing the output and makes various new things possible, such as
querying sources/patches from the header.

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

I consider this fixed in HEAD now, although quite differently:

-   %files section is not required in order to generate packages (with
    no files in them) anymore
-   there\'s a new \'rpmspec\' command line tool which allows querying
    either source or binary headers from a spec, complete with target
    overriding and query formatting.
