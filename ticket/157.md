Permissions not attached to files in chroots

### Description {#comment:description}

Installation with rpm \--root yields:

/srv/nfs/base32\# linux32 rpm \--root \$PWD -Uhv
cups-client-1.3.11-4.5.1.i586.rpm Preparing\...
\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#
\[100%\]

> 1:cups-client warning: user lp does not exist - using root( 26%)

warning: group lp does not exist - using root
\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#
\[100%\]

And that despite lp existing in both /etc/{passwd,group} and
/srv/nfs/base32/etc/{passwd,group}. Looks non-trivial. Any idea what
could be done?

-   **owner** changed from *RpmTickets* to *pmatilai*.
-   **status** changed from *new* to *assigned*.

Basically that means getpwnam() is failing for whatever reason. Rpm
(tries to) preload nss libraries before chroot() to ensure working name
services inside chroots but maybe there\'s a new catch here or
something\...

Try to get a strace log of the thing, that should provide some clues to
what\'s going on.

It is reproducible using one\'s own system root itself, i.e.

rpm \--root / -Uhv ts.rpm

FWIW I can\'t reproduce this. ts.spec does complain about user sys not
existing but rightfully so as on Fedora there\'s no such user (only
group called \"sys\"), and using other user/group names doesn\'t change
the situation. Need to dig into the strace\...

Looking at the strace log, this has to do with the host being configured
to use LDAP for user information and the system not falling back to
/etc/{passwd,group} when not found in LDAP.

-   **status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

This is likely to be the same issue as the one reported here:
