-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

The patch misses handling of tagtbl.c include in lib/tagname.c which
causes the out of source build fail too. Fixed now in HEAD, thanks for
the patch + reporting.

Ah, I forgot that I \"fixed\" it by adding -I. to CPPFLAGS (which I have
to set anyway because of
[\#61](61 "Configure does not find nss and nspr (closed)")).
