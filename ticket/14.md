### Description {#comment:description}

It\'s nice to let the rpm library do the dirty work of parsing a spec
file, but the Python library doesn\'t allow extracting information from
the resulting headers. The attached patch remedies this with two new
spec object methods: sourceHeader and packageHeaders.

These methods return most of the same information you\'d get by building
the package and reading the headers from the source rpm (sourceHeader)
or binary rpms (packageHeaders).

That\'s most, not all, because rpmbuild adds certain information to the
headers when building a package, such as Provides for any .so files in a
binary rpm. But for many applications, all the information you need is
right there in the spec file, and these new methods give you a
convenient way to access it from Python. For example:

      import rpm
      s = rpm.ts().parseSpec("foo.spec")
      print s.sourceHeader()["name"]
      print s.packageHeaders()[0]["name"]

Implement spec file header methods

-   **status** changed from *new* to *assigned*.

FYI, another patch towards the same goal was recently posted to
rpm-maint list. The functionality is certainly welcome, I\'ll review the
patches and merge either / best parts as soon as I find the time. In any
case, thanks for the patch.

### 02/23/09 14:46:46 changed by pmatilai {#comment:2}

-   **keywords** set to *Python*.

### 10/12/10 13:04:10 changed by pmatilai {#comment:3}

-   **status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

This is finally fully implemented in HEAD. Access to binary headers
through packages went in 4.8.0 but the source part was missing, some
rationale behind that explained in
