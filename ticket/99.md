### Description {#comment:description}

It would be much nicer if RPM would detect unwritable directories or
file system in advance and error out. Shouldn\'t be too expensive as we
stat() everything anyway.

by a simple hack of making read-only filesystems appear as full. Of
course it could be extended to specifically complain about read-only fs
but me thinks read-only == full is a reasonable and simple mapping with
practically no extra code.
