\[PATCH\] use the right variable for absolute path

  Reported by:   agriffis   Assigned to:   RpmTickets
  Priority:      minor      Milestone:     rpm-4.9.0

### Description {#comment:description}

Patch attached to fix the problem where rpm attempts to use the tarball
as the specfile. This is due to a simple coding error.

    $ /usr/bin/rpmbuild --define='_topdir work/foo' -ta work/foo-0.9.tar.gz 
    error: File /home/agriffis/work/foo-0.9.tar.gz does not appear to be a specfile.

Fixing this reveals other problems when dealing with relative paths, but
the fix for this specific problem is obvious at least.
