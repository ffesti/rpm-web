RFE: ability to show scriptlet program arguments

### Description {#comment:description}

There does not seem to be any way to display scriptlet program
arguments.

For example, for `%post -p "/bin/echo hello"` I could not find any way
to get the \"hello\" displayed or queried, only the /bin/echo part is
shown.

    $ rpm -qp --scripts foo-1.0-3.fc14.x86_64.rpm 
    postinstall program: /bin/echo

    $ rpm -qp --qf="%{POSTINPROG}\n" foo-1.0-3.fc14.x86_64.rpm 
    /bin/echo

    $ rpm -qp --qf="%{POSTINFLAGS}\n" foo-1.0-3.fc14.x86_64.rpm 
    (none)

-   **owner** changed from *RpmTickets* to *pmatilai*.
-   **status** changed from *new* to *assigned*.

The trick is that FOOPROG tags are actually arrays if more than one
argument is present (see
[http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=blob;f=build/parseScript.c;hb=HEAD](https://web.archive.org/web/20150920130113/http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=blob;f=build/parseScript.c;hb=HEAD)
from line 326 onwards). You can use \--qf=\"\[%{POSTINPROG} \]\\n\" to
get the other arguments.

Thanks for pointing this out, there are a few places that should be
updated to reflect the reality: \--scripts alias needs to use the array
query format and VERIFYSCRIPTPROG is missing completely from the output.
Will fix. Also the tag types in rpmtag.h probably need changing from
\"s\" to \"s\[\]\", although I need to verify it doesn\'t break anything
else (the tag types are supposedly static but there are a few exceptions
like this where things get a bit funny).

### (follow-up: [[↓ 3]{.small}](#comment:3) ) 09/12/11 09:40:07 changed by pmatilai {#comment:2}

-   **status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

Okay, fixed in HEAD, \--scripts query now also shows all scriptlet
interpreter arguments if present:

    [pmatilai@localhost ~]$ rpm -qp --scripts /home/pmatilai/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/argtest-1.0-4.x86_64.rpm
    preinstall program: /bin/echo -a -c -e
    postinstall scriptlet (using /bin/sh -x):
    echo "echo this"
    preuninstall scriptlet (using /bin/bash --posix --version -l -v -x):
    echo "echo that"
    postuninstall scriptlet (using /bin/sh):
    echo "postun, nuting special"
    posttrans scriptlet (using /usr/bin/python):
    print "foo"
    verify program: /sbin/ldconfig -x -y
    [pmatilai@localhost ~]$

While at it, some related bugs also fixed: accessing the fooprog tags
are now defined as array types, meaning eg python accessing them will
return the full array instead of just the first item. In addition,
%verifyscript interpreter wasn\'t shown at all, and attempting to pass
arguments to trigger scriptlet interpreters now fails at build-time
(previously they were just silently discarded).

BTW if rpmlint examines the fooprog tags, it\'ll need to be adjusted to
expect arrays whereas it previously just got single strings (and for
compatibility, it probably should handle both cases the best it can)

Thanks, hopefully done sufficiently in
