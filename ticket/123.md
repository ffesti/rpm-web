### Description {#comment:description}

It\'d be nice to have RPMBUILD\_IS\* constants from rpmspec.h available
in Python for examining source flags from rpm.spec.sources().

I seem to recall not adding these with the intent of adding a saner way
to access sources/patches etc to the bindings instead, but otoh this
permits implementing some nicer spec method from python instead of C.
I\'ll try to remember to pull this into 4.8.x branch too.
