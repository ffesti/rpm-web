### Description {#comment:description}

It\'s annoying having to cd between dirs and when applying patches that
are generated with their toplevel dir below the toplevel dir extracted
from sources. The attached patch against current git (warning: compile
tested only) allows using -d with %patch to \"fix\" this.

Seems to work\... Applied, thanks for the patch.

Although all these %patch options make me want to just let it pass any
unknown stuff down to the actual patch command without trying to
validate but \... that\'s another story.
