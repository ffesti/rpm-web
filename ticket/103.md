Improve duplicate %trigger\* handling in specfiles

### Description {#comment:description}

When a specfile contains more than one %post or one of the other
\"usual\" scriptlets, rpmbuild refuses to build it and outputs an error
message. However, this doesn\'t happen with duplicate
%triggerin/%triggerun/%triggerpostun. The package builds fine but it
seems that later duplicate definitions are simply silently discarded.

I think either the duplicates should error out builds like with
duplicate %post and friends, or alternatively all of them should be kept
and executed when appropriate.

For example:

    %triggerin -- foo
    echo footrigger1

    %triggerin -- foo
    echo footrigger2

If not failing the build, I think this should result in both triggers
being run when the trigger for foo fires. As of rpm 4.7.1 the latter
trigger seems to be discarded.

Indeed, rpm 4.6.0 - 4.7.1 incorrectly discards triggers with identical
conditions. Fixed already in HEAD, just pending maintenance updates to
both 4.6.x and 4.7.x.

-   **status** changed from *new* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

Fixed in the just-released rpm 4.7.2 too now.
