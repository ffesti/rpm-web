### Description {#comment:description}

The following script demonstrates what I think are two problems with
non-empty rpm.mi boolean value and len/count():

    import rpm
    ts = rpm.TransactionSet()
    mi = ts.dbMatch()
    mi.pattern("name", rpm.RPMMIRE_GLOB, "r*")
    if mi:
        print "mi true"
    else:
        print "mi false"
    try:
        print "len: %d" % len(mi)
    except:
        pass
    print "count(): %d" % mi.count()
    c = 0
    for m in mi:
        c += 1
    print "real: %d" % c

With 4.4.2.3 on CentOS 5 I get:

    mi true
    count(): 0
    real: 15

With 4.7.2 on Fedora 12 I get:

    mi true
    count(): 0
    real: 37

With 4.8.0 on Fedora 13 I get:

    mi false
    len: 0
    count(): 0
    real: 25

Observations:

-   The boolean value of non-empty mi changed incompatibly between 4.7.2
    and 4.8.0 (breaks for example installed package globbing in rpmlint)
-   I think both mi.count() and len(mi) are (and have been) somehow
    broken in this case, they should return the same number as the
    \"real\" IMO but return 0

On the other hand, mi\'s returned from for example
`ts.dbMatch("name", "rpm")` behave like I\'d expect in all these
versions, both truth value and len/count() wise.

Hmm, the behavior change here is not intentional, I\'ll need to check
where that comes from. The python bindings saw quite a churn between
4.7.x and 4.8.x so, its more surprising that there has been so few
(reported) breakages than the other way around :)

The iterator count has always been rather broken (on C-level too): it
only works on exact matches against index tags. Eg:

> > > mi = ts.dbMatch(\'name\') mi.count()

0

> > > mi = ts.dbMatch(\'name\', \'kernel\') mi.count()

-   **owner** changed from *RpmTickets* to *pmatilai*.
-   **status** changed from *new* to *assigned*.

Right\... this is the cause:
[http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html\#truth-value-testing](https://web.archive.org/web/20151210102412/http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing)

> instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a nonzero() or
> len() method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value
> False.

Now that the iterator implements `__len__()`, that\'s what gets used for
truth value whereas any mi instance previously always returned True,
just like \"foo = object()\" evals to True. Reverting to former behavior
is easily achieved by adding `__nonzero__()` which always returns True,
which is probably the less surprising behavior, considering how unusable
the `__len__()` method is due to its unreliability.

Thanks for looking into this. Let me know if you find a \"fix\" and
intend to ship it for Fedora 13 - I have a trivial fix for this already
in rpmlint svn but won\'t bother shipping an update for this purpose if
you intend to push a rpm update.

-   **status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.

Okay, fixed now:
[http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=40f788a7bf3741f9c613ff302d4e1b0ceec2658c](https://web.archive.org/web/20151210102412/http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=40f788a7bf3741f9c613ff302d4e1b0ceec2658c)

This is not actually 100% identical behavior to pre-4.8.0 which returned
True no matter what, whereas now the truth value actually sorta means
something (you get False when it knows there are no matches at all)

On the Fedora-side of things: fixed now in rawhide and will pull to F13
in near future, there are a few other fixes pending for 13 too.
