### Description {#comment:description}

It would be nice when \'quilt\'
([http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt](https://web.archive.org/web/20151226231506/http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt))
is supported for managing the patchsets. When having packages with much
patches, it is often difficulty to rediff them as multiple patches might
affect one source file and the usual \'gendiff\' will fail then.

\'quilt\' eases rediffing and generation of new patches very much (e.g.
see its manpage).

To use \'quilt\' a

\| %patch1 -p 1 -b .foo

has to be translated to

\| quilt import -p 1 %PATCH1 && quilt push

The \'-b \...\' is to be ignored. The conventional \'patch\' method must
stay but there should be a way to switch to \'quilt\'.

Yup, the traditional %patch approach is getting a bit old and tired.
Mandriva actually has patches to do something like this with git, and I
see no reason why the approach couldn\'t be integrated a bit tighter and
generalized to work with quilt, hg, bzr and such (to let each developer
use what they\'re most familiar with). Also related to ticket
[\#13](13 "RFE: Having macro `%patches' would be good for aplying a list of patches.  ... (new)").

-   **status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*.
-   **resolution** set to *fixed*.
-   **milestone** set to *rpm-4.11.0*.

There\'s now an rough initial implementation in rpm.org master with some
new macros:
[http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=6c5214950e5885c33c498969ca256c9550f5936b](https://web.archive.org/web/20151226231506/http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=6c5214950e5885c33c498969ca256c9550f5936b)
[http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=5322c3bd4bb99e9f1221eeddaf8de4da0f729e99](https://web.archive.org/web/20151226231506/http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=5322c3bd4bb99e9f1221eeddaf8de4da0f729e99)

I\'m suspect things will change somewhat (eg %autosetup should probably
default to applying all the patches instead of requiring an option to do
it) but its usable for early testing and the macros should work with any
rpm \>= 4.6.0 version. As it is, basically replace \"%setup\" with
\"%autosetup -A -S \<scm\>\" (regular %setup options accepted as well,
replace \<scm\> with git, hg, bzr or quilt and add eg -p1 if you need)
to have the expanded sources and patch applications to be brought under
version control.
