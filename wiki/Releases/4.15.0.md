 * rpmteVerified() to retrieve verify status of transaction elements
 * rpmdbCookie() to retrieve a cookie for database change tracking, useful

#### Changed APIs
 * Fix headerCheck() return code mismatch & regression in 4.14.x
 * Fix rpmVerifySignatures() verify flags regression in rpm >= 4.14
 * Remove file size return value from rpmDoDigest() parameters
 * Remove partial support for unused MD2 and RIPEMD160 digests

 * Redundant VERIFY_FOO file symbols removed, RPMVERIFY_FOO should be used instead
 * Remove deprecated and unused rpmVerifyFile()
 * Remove rpmvf.h header, relevant contents moved to rpmfiles.h and rpmcli.h

### Internal improvements and cleanups
 * Cleanups to IMA file signing, query/verify filtering, ordering, macro
   engine, spec parsing, build script running, signature generation,
   main rpm executable
 * Consolidate dependency knowledge into a struct/table
 * Add thread protection to the string pool
 * Optimize built-in macro primitive execution
 * Optimize and refactor dependency generator for the future
 * Fix wrong string size on headers coming from rpmdb (#398)

 * Fix use of ambgiuous logical operators in various script conditionals
 * Remove support for prelink undo in digest calculation

### Build process
 * Add numerous testcases
 * Add switch to disable systemd-inhibit plugin (#361)
 * Add support for building rpm without Berkeley DB (--disable-bdb)
 * Add colors to test-suite output where supported
 * Fix BDB build when automatically selecting internal BDB
 * Fix Lua and Python tests failing if not enabled in configure
 * Fix rpm forcing -fPIC -DPIC build flags on itself
 * Fix test-suite depending on functional DNS
 * Fix test-suite race around gpg-agent during distcheck
 * Python bindings default to Python 3, Python 2 is deprecated (minimum
   version is Python 2.7)
 * Support Lua 5.2 - 5.3 without compatibility hacks, drop support for 5.1
 * Remove --with-external-db configure switch, simplify logic

## Compatibility notes
 * File trigger second argument eliminated (aka $2)
 * Spec files mixing numberless patch/source syntax with patch/source number 0
   will not work anymore
 * Source and Patch lines are now expanded just once when encountered in
   the spec, any macros used in them need to be already defined. This
   will also affect setups where spec defined macros are used in
   build tree macros such as `%_sourcedir` (a practise that was always
   discouraged)
