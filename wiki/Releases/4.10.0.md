### Package building

 * Add support for 7zip compressed sources
 * Fix package generation in presence of high inode numbers ([RhBug:714678](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=714678))
 * Order hardlinks in a deltarpm friendlier way

#### Automatic dependency generation
 * Extract perl dependecies from "use parent qw(Foo)"

 * Automatic download of sources and patches if they dont exist locally. This feature is disabled
   by default however as there is currently no means to verify (the digest of) the downloaded content.
 * Add support for automatic namespacing of dependency generator output,
   settable by %__attr_namespace macro in file attribute config and/or specs,
   eg "%__elf_namespace foo" to wrap all elf dependency output with "foo(...)"
   Note that current dependency generators typically hardcode their
   own namespace, generators need to be modified to fully support this.
 * Updated file attribute rules for working with file >= 5.10 too
 * Fix classification of ELF binaries with setuid/setgid bits
 * Recognize "font collection" as fonts in file classification

 * Generate debug symlinks for all filenames sharing a build-id ([RhBug:641377](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=641377))
 * Warn but don't fail the build when STABS debuginfo encountered ([RhBug:725378](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=725378), others)

### Removed features
 * Support for long since deprecated OpenPGP V3 public keys has been removed.
   V3 signatures are still supported however.
 * Removed detection for various prehistoric systems
 * Support for "fpio" (aka libc FILE) streams has been removed from the
   rpm IO subsystem.
 * Unused and unmaintained java dependency generator has been removed

### API changes

#### New interfaces
 * New improved interfaces headerImport() and headerExport() 
   deprecating headerLoad() and headerUnload()
 * Base64 manipulation API: rpmBase64Encode(), rpmBase64Decode() and
   rpmBase64CRC() 
 * rpmKeyringVerifySig() keyring method for simpler signature verification
 * New interfaces for OpenPGP packet manipulation: pgpPrtParams(),
   pgpDigParamsCmp(), pgpDigParamsAlgo(), pgpDigGetParams(), pgpDigParamsFree()
 * New low-level pgpVerifySignature() signature verification function
 * Rpm IO file descriptors now remember the path they were opened with
   (when applicaple). This is retrievable with a new Fdescr() function.
 * New rpmdsMatchesDep() function, allowing use of index from rpmdb
   queries
 * Export rpm's string hashing function in librpmio as rstrhash()
 * New rpmtdFlags() function for retrieving flags of a tag data container

#### Removed / internalized interfaces
 * rpmShowProgress() internal state variables are no longer exported
 * pgpLen() function has been removed (buggy and unsafe)
 * headerCheckPayloadFormat(), headerMergeLegacySigs() and
   headerRegenSigHeader() functions have been removed / made internal.
 * fdNew() function has been removed from the API, file descritors
   can only be created by Fopen() and friends
 * fdGetFILE() function has been removed (FILE streams are no longer supported)
 * timedRead() function has been removed
 * rpmsqFork() and rpmsqWait() functions have been removed
 * rpmSetTables() function has been made internal

#### Other interface changes
 * Transaction progress callback enhancements:
   * RPMCALLBACK_UNINST_PROGRESS now reflects real erasure progress
   * New RPMCALLBACK_INST_STOP callback event issued when package install stops
   * New RPMCALLBACK_SCRIPT_START and RPMCALLBACK_SCRIPT_STOP callback
     events issued on package scriptlet start and stop (RhBug:606239).
 * pgpExtractPubkeyFingerprint() and rpmPubkeyNew() now properly handle
   and propagate errors from pgpPubkeyFingerprint() failure.
 * Implicit self-provides and RPMTAG_OPTFLAGS are now added during
   rpmSpecParse() already
 * Change type of scriptlet argument tags (RPMTAG_PREINPROG etc) to
   string arrays which they always have been
 * New RPMTAG_FILENLINKS tag extension for retrieving file link counts
 * New tag extensions for pretty-formatting dependency data:
   RPMTAG_REQUIRENEVRS, RPMTAG_PROVIDENEVRS, RPMTAG_OBSOLETENEVRS and
   RPMTAG_CONFLICTNEVRS
 * New RPMTAG_INSTFILENAMES tag extension for retrieving state
   aware file lists (ie non-installed files are not listed)
 * New RPMTAG_FILENLINKS tag extension for retrieving file link counts
 * New RPMDBI_INSTFILENAMES pseudo-index for retrieving only installed files
 * Fread() and Fwrite() on NULL descriptor now return an error
 * Support Ftell() on zlib compressed streams
 * Fix crashes and other issues on non-fpio Fflush()
 * fdFree() now always return NULL like other "destructor" functions in rpm
 * rpmdsRpmlib() returns error code on failure
 * rpmtsImportPubkey() now honors RPMTRANS_FLAG_TEST flag if set
 * Arbitrary limitation on rpmtsSetKeyring() removed, keyring change
   is now permitted at all times
 * Transaction set keyring is never automatically loaded when 
   signature checking is disabled via rpmtsSetVSFlags()
 * rpmfiNew() can now fail and return NULL on headers with inconsistent file
   list data.
 * rpmtsAddInstallElement() and rpmtsAddEraseElement() can now fail
   on headers with inconsistent or missing data
 * rpmtsRun() now fully recalculates file dispositions even if a test-run
   was done on the same transaction set earlier. This allows
   symlink <-> directory replacement tricks in %pretrans to work again on
   clients like yum which first perform a test-transaction.
 * headerGet() now sets RPMTD_INVALID flag on tag data containers when
   retrieval fails due to inconsistent data (primarily extensions)
 * ufdCopy() now returns off_t to permit correct return code on large files

### Internal improvements and cleanups
 * Much stronger header validity and consistency checks
 * Much stronger OpenPGP packet validity and consistency checks
 * File state machine and its interfaces cleaned up and simplified
 * Use temporary suffix on install even if clock is wrong
 * Optimizations for string length calculations on header import
 * Optimizations for header loading from rpmdb
 * Optimizations and cleanups to public key and signature manipulation
 * Optimizations, corrections and cleanups to OpenPGP packet manipulation
 * Optimizations for header data retrieval in python bindings

 * Fix potential crash on Fclose() errors on XZ/LZMA streams
 * Add internal interfaces for scriptlet manipulation, make rpmScript opaque
 * Remember dependency set color through rpmdsCurrent()
 * Fix file state on colored file replacements
 * File descriptor IO cleanups
 * Database manipulation cleanups: improved internal APIs, replace
   assert() deaths with proper error handling etc
 * Sanitize internal package lead section API
 * Simplify dependency generator execution
 * Mass-elimination of unused and dead variable manipulations (assignments,
   increments...) and related cleanups throughout the codebase
 * Validate semantic correctness of various inter-related tags (such as filename triplets)
 * Numerous previously ignored error conditions are now properly handled
 * On Linux, make AT_PLATFORM and AT_HWCAP available to internal hardware detection code
 * Remove piles of ancient bit-rotten platform-specific macros
 * Remove unused SELinux file context path macros
 * Remove libio usage to provide consistent sematics for Fread() and Fwrite() 

### Python bindings
 * Add RPMSENSE_PRETRANS and RPMSENSE_POSTTRANS constants
 * Add module-level rpm.reloadConfig() function for resetting and/or
   reloading global rpm configuration
 * Add clear() method to transaction set objects (to remove all transaction members)
 * Add name property to rpm.fd objects, similar to Python file objects
 * Add __reduce__() method to header objects to support pickling and copying
 * Fix transaction element Parent() method to return correct type
 * Fix crash in rpm.fd object conversion on error
 * Fix crash on list construction error in low-memory conditions
 * Fix memory leaks on rpm.fd object conversion and in the deprecated
   hdr.fiFromHeader(), hdr.dsFromHeader() and hdr.dsOfHeader() methods

 * Replace uses of deprecated PyCObject with PyCapsule ([RhBug:623864](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=623864))
 * Retrieving header data can now raise rpm.error exception on invalid data
 
### Build process
 * Remove distro/vendor autodetection from configure. $build_vendor is
   used for "canonical vendor" unless overridden by --with-vendor=<name>.
   NOTE: this affects macro configuration + rpmrc search paths and
   %{_vendor} macro default value.
 * Create and install platform configuration for all known architectures,
   on all OS'es
 * Do not attempt running the test-suite without fakechroot (ticket [#851](https://rpm.org/ticket/851))
 * Do not require support for XZ compression in the test-suite
 * Fix build with newer Berkeley DB versions when not using --with-external-db
 * Support for ancient bzip2 library versions removed
 * zlib is now considered a mandatory library
 * Several new test-suite cases
 * Except for compilation, test-suite now runs fully inside fakechroot
 * Remove unused checks from configure
 * Build can be silenced on automake versions which support it
 * Python bindings can now be alternatively built with Python distutils,
   making it simpler to build the bindings for different Python versions,
   notably 2.x vs 3.x ([RhBug:531543](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=531543))

## Compatibility notes
 * Packages utilizing the new tilde version handling cannot be correctly upgraded by older
   versions of RPM. The use of this feature is tracked with new rpmlib(TildeInVersions) dependency.
 * Programs parsing --percent mode output are likely to require adjustments
   due to the added erasure progress and package info format change: package
   NEVRA is now used instead of NVR.
 * The way hardlinks in packages was changed to flatten the inode numbers
   to single virtual int32_t space instead of using physical device and inode pairs from
   buildroot files. This makes inode and device numbers predictable and reproducable
   across builds and avoids issues with very large inode/device numbers on 64bit filesystems.
   The change is supposed to be fully backwards compatible with former rpm (and cpio)
   versions as the numerical semantics are preserved, this compatibility note is
   "just for the record."
