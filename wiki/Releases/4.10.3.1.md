# RPM 4.10.3.1 Release Notes



## Download information
 * [rpm-4.10.3.1.tar.bz2](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/rpm/releases/historical/rpm-4.10.x/rpm-4.10.3.1.tar.bz2) source

## Summary of changes from RPM 4.10.3

Shortly after the release of RPM 4.10.3, a critical last-minute regression
in %ghost %config behavior was discovered and the 4.10.3 release was
pulled from downloads entirely as the regression could cause data loss:
4.10.3 could in some situations remove %ghost %config files
on package upgrades.  To protect the innocent, the potentially dangerous
4.10.3 release will not be reintroduced on rpm.org at all.

## General bugfixes and enhancements
 * Fix regression introduced in RPM 4.10.3 where %ghost %config files could
   get removed on package upgrade in some cases.
 * See [4.10.3 release notes](4.10.3.html) for other changes since
   rpm 4.10.2

## Build proces
 * Add test-cases for %ghost and %ghost %config behavior.
