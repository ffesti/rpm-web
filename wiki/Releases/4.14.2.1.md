## Summary of changes from RPM 4.14.2

### Security fixes ###

 * Fix regression in --setperms, --setugids and --restore (RhBug:1640470) in 4.14.2:

   In case of --setperms, all encountered symlinks would have their
   target file/directory permissions set to the 0777 of the link itself
   (so world writable etc but suid/sgid stripped), temporarily or permanently,
   depending on whether the symlink occurs before or after it's target in the
   package file list. When the link occurs before its target, there's a short
   window where the target is world writable before having it's permissions
   reset to original, making it particularly bad for suid/sgid binaries.
    
   --setugids was similarly affected with link targets owner/group changing
   to that of the symlink.

   --restore was affected as it utilizes --setperms and --setugids to do
   it's task.

   **Note that this update can not automatically fix possible damage
     done by using --setperms, --setugids or --restore with rpm 4.14.2,
     it merely fixes the functionlity itself. Any damage needs to be
     investigated and fixed manually, such as using --verify and --restore
     or reinstalling packages.**

### General bugfixes ###

 * Fix package verification memory leak introduced in 4.14.2
 * Fix long-standing Python GIL locking bug
 * Fix long-standing broken library path of embedded Lua
